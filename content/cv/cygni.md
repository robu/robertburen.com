All the assignments in this category have been as a consultant for Cygni. Robert co-founded Cygni in 2006, and it has been quite a journey. There are a lot of things to say and a lot of things he is proud of about Cygni, but in this small space, he just want to highlight the awards from Great Place to Work (the World's biggest employee survey) where Cygni was ranked as the **best workplace in Sweden** seven years, and the **best in Europe** five years!

Cygni was acquired by Accenture in 2021, and Robert is now employed by "Cygni, part of Accenture".

Below are some of the most significant assignments Robert has had as a consultant for Cygni. Outside of these assignments, he has supported his colleagues in Cygni with sales, recruitment, professional development, and shorter analysis and advisory assignments.
