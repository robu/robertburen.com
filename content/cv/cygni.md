All the assignments in this category have been as a consultant for Cygni. We founded Cygni in 2006, and it has been quite a journey. There are a lot of things to say and a lot of things I am proud of about Cygni, but in this small space, I just want to highlight the awards from Great Place to Work (the World's biggest employee survey) where Cygni was ranked as the **best workplace in Sweden** seven years, and the **best in Europe** five years!

Cygni was acquired by Accenture in 2021, and I am now employed by "Cygni, part of Accenture".

Below are some of the most significant assignments I have had as a consultant for Cygni. Outside of these assignments, I have supported my colleagues in Cygni with sales, recruitment, professional development, and shorter analysis and advisory assignments.
