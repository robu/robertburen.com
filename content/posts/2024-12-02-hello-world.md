Creating a blog at this point feels like dusting off the old fax machine, but I do feel that I need a place to keep note of stuff and thoughts on random topics. Some of the topics may be related to my work as a CTO or software developer, and I'll likely keep those in English. Other topics may be more local or personal, and I'll probably keep those in Swedish.
