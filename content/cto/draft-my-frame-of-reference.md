_Summary: I have been CTO/CIO for companies with tech departments between 50-400 people, except for a couple of very small startups with just a small handful of technicians. The common thread in the tech aspect of these companies is that they have a significant amount of in-house development. Typically, the tech department has the highest headcount of the departments in the company._

## Unibet

My first CTO gig was at Unibet (now Kindred) starting in January 2011. Unibet had spun off its sportsbook into its own product company ("Kambi"), and the then CTO was part of that spin-off.
